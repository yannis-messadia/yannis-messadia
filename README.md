- 🌱 I'm also learning about web developpement (HMTL, CSS)
- 👯 I'd love to connect with my seniors to open my mind about AI and programming in general ! I strongly value the experience of my predecessors and the inspiration I can get from them !

## 📁 My projects 

### Creating a basic fansite about Shiro Sagisu
I heard that programmation is all about learning by doing. So I tried to create a local fansite about a compositor i'm very enthousiast about : Shiro Sagisu, the man behind Bleach, Evangelion and Berserk's most memorable OSTs.

- I used **HTML and CSS**
- With the objective to **learn the basics about web programming** by creating a simple but functionnal website
- Functionalities : **responsive design**, **sticky navbars**, **contact forms**, **flexbox**


### Main takeaways
- I learnt on **how to structure** a website using HTML
- I learnt the **basics of stylisation** with CSS
- I had my first collaborative coding experience with Git for this project ! What works, **teamwork** !
